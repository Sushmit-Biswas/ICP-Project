# `hello` - Sushmit Biswas

Welcome to the `hello` project! This repository is designed to help you kickstart your development journey on the Internet Computer. The provided template files offer a great starting point and are fully customizable, allowing you to integrate your own code to accelerate your development process.

## 🌐 Visit My First Blockchain Website!

I'm excited to share my very first website on the blockchain, hosted on the Internet Computer! Check it out:

Dive into the world of decentralized applications and see what the power of blockchain can achieve. Your feedback and thoughts are always welcome!


## 📂 Project Structure

Feel free to explore the project directory structure and tweak the default configuration file. This setup is designed for local development and testing, ensuring that any changes you make won't impact your production deployments or identity tokens.

## 📚 Documentation & Resources

Get familiar with the development environment through the following resources:

- [Quick Start Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/deploy-locally)
- [SDK Developer Tools](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/setup/install)
- [Motoko Programming Language Guide](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/motoko/main/motoko)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ready to dive in? Here are some essential commands to start working with the project:

```bash
cd hello/
dfx help
dfx canister --help
```

## 🛠️ Running the Project Locally
You can test your project in a local environment using the following commands:
```bash
# Start the Internet Computer replica locally
dfx start --background

# Deploy your canisters and generate a candid interface
dfx deploy
```
After deploying, your application will be accessible at: 
```
http://localhost:4943?canisterId={asset_canister_id}
```

## ⚙️ Regenerate Candid Interface
If you've made changes to the backend canister, regenerate the candid interface with:
```bash
npm run generate
```
It's recommended to do this before starting frontend development, although it runs automatically during ```dfx deploy```.

## 🎨 Starting the Frontend Development Server
For frontend changes, run:
```bash
npm start
```
This starts a local server at:
```
http://localhost:8080
```
It proxies API requests to the replica running on port 4943, creating a seamless development experience.

## ⚠️ Note on Frontend Environment Variables
When hosting frontend code without using DFX, make sure to adjust the configuration to prevent fetching the root key in production:

⭕ Set ```DFX_NETWORK``` to ic ```if``` using Webpack.

⭕ Use your preferred method to replace ```process.env.DFX_NETWORK``` in autogenerated declarations.

⭕ Update ```dfx.json``` with: </li>

```json
{
  "canisters": {
    "{asset_canister_id}": {
      "declarations": {
        "env_override": "your-string"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
⭕ Customize your createActor constructor as needed.
